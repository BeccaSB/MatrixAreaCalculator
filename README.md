## Grid Area Calculator

This C# program efficiently calculates the maximum area of a grid based on a list of upper-right coordinates provided as input. It parses the input coordinates, identifies the minimum row and column values among them, and computes the maximum area by multiplying these minimum values. The program offers an optimized solution for minimizing the number of rows and columns required to cover all specified coordinates, making it suitable for various grid-based optimization problems.

### Features:
- Parses input coordinates to identify minimum row and column values.
- Computes maximum area by multiplying the minimum row and column values.
- Offers an optimized solution for minimizing the number of rows and columns required to cover all specified coordinates.

### Usage:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of upper-right coordinates to input.
3. Input the upper-right coordinates as pairs of space-separated integers.
4. The program will calculate the maximum area and display the result.

### Dependencies:
- None

### Notes:
- This program assumes that the input coordinates are valid and formatted correctly.
- It provides a simple and efficient solution for maximizing the area of a grid based on given coordinates.
